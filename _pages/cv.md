Education
======
* B.S. in Medicinal Chemistry, China Pharmaceutical University, 2016-2020
* M.S. in Pharmaceutical modeling, Upppsala University, 2020-2022


Work experience
======
* 2021-2022: Master's Thesis intern
  * AstraZeneca, Sweden
  * Title: Property prediction model by regression Siamese Neural Network with transformer structure
  * SMILES preprocessing protocol with RDkit: removing charges, canonical SMILES, remove chirality etc..
  * Neural networks development with PyTorch: 2 simple neural networks (MLP-FP MLP-âˆ†FP) for validation of the idea, and then the SNN with SMILES as input and use subtraction of hidden states for regression. The models were compared with MolNet and the simple one already showed better result.
  * Packages: Pytorch, RDKit, Molvs, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, matplot
